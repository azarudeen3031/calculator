This Java program is a simple console-based calculator that allows users to perform both arithmetic and logical operations. Users can choose between two main categories of operations: Arithmetic and Logical.

Arithmetic Operations
1.Addition (+): Adds two numbers together.

2.Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.

3.Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.

4.Division (/): Divides the first number by the second (division by zero is handled).

5.Modulus (%): Calculates the remainder of the division of the first number by the second.

6.Exponentiation (^): Raises the first number to the power of the second.

7.Percentage (p): Calculates the percentage of the first number relative to the second.


Logical Operations

Power: Allows users to calculate the power of a base raised to an exponent.
Square Root: Computes the square root of a non-negative number.
Logarithm (base 10): Calculates the base 10 logarithm of a positive number.
How to Use
Select the desired operation category by entering '1' for Arithmetic or '2' for Logical.
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the required values for the chosen operation.
The program will then display the result of the operation.
The code uses a switch-case statement to handle different operations based on user input and includes error handling to handle edge cases like division by zero, taking the square root of negative numbers, or calculating logarithms of non-positive numbers.

This calculator is a simple educational tool to demonstrate basic Java programming concepts and mathematical operations.
